# HTML Lists/Media Graded Class Work

### Exercise 1:
Reproduce the list represented in the image file ```img/sample_list.png``` using CSS for any required formatting.

### Exercise 2:
Reproduce BDog's Birthday invited represented in the image ```img/bday_invitation.png```

* Use appropriate CSS to reproduce the invitation title at the top of the invite

* Use the small image in ```img/cake.png``` for each list item, replacing the default bullet. Be sure to consider properties such as padding.

* Use the image for BDog from ```img/bday_dog.jpg``` and use CSS so that it displays to the right of the list

* Use an inline frame to display a map to the party at the bottom of the invite. For convenience, the value for frame source is provided below, but look up and experiment with any other <iframe> element attributes as needed.
